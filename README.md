## Hi there, I'm Carolina Baeta!

#### I’m a final-year engineering student at Télécom Paris (Data Science & AI).  
#### I like turning complex problems into clear decisions, with a practical and reliable way of working.


Right now, I’m a master’s-level engineering student (Diplôme d’Ingénieur) at Télécom Paris.  
In **2A**, I followed **SD (Data Science)** and **MODS (Markets, Organizations, Data, Strategies)** tracks; 
in **3A**, I’m specializing on **AI** with a research project on diffusion-based hypergraph generation.  
Before that, I was in a **B.Sc. in Computer Science** program at **UFMG** and spent time in **front-end** at **iJunior Soluções Digitais**, so you’ll find here a mix of my different chapters!

**Focus:** Data Science · Machine Learning · Deep Learning  
**Skills:** Python · SQL · scikit-learn · PyTorch · Git

*Availability: 6-month end-of-study internship from **March 2026** (Paris).*
